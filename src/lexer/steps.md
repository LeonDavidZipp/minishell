## 1. Input Reading
Read the input from the terminal. This could be a single line or multiple lines of code.

## 2. Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)
The input string is broken down into meaningful units known as tokens. Each token represents a component of the language, such as a keyword, identifier, operator, or literal.

## 3. Syntax Analysis (Parsing)
The tokens are arranged according to the rules of the language's grammar to form a parse tree. This step checks the tokens for syntactic correctness.

## 4. Semantic Analysis
The parse tree is checked for semantic correctness. This step includes type checking, scope resolution, and other validations.

## AST Generation
The parse tree or the optimized intermediate code is used to generate the Abstract Syntax Tree. The AST represents the syntactic structure of the source code in a way that is easier to analyze and manipulate than the original source code.

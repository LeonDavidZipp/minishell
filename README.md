## Description
The Minishell project at Ã‰cole 42 is a fundamental step in learning about operating systems and shell scripting.
It challenges students to create a simple bash-inspired shell from scratch, capable of interpreting and executing commands entered by the user.
The project is written in C. Many students consider Minishell to be one of the two most important, if not the most important project during the
42 curriculum.
### Main Learnings
#### 1. Parsing & Tokenization
The first important step in creating our project.
